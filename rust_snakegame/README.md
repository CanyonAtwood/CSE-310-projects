# Overview

{In this assignmnet I am learning RUST! This language is something that I have never done. The goal with this is to become decently proficient in the rust language, its syntax and how to make a basic program (this being a snake program) }

{With the Rust language we are creating the snake game. In this program the snake will gather food and when it eats the food it will gain points and grow longer. As the snake becomes longer it becomes more and more difficult to move. If the snake comes in contact with iteself it dies.}

{The purpose of writing this software is to learn another programming language (RUST)}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I need to get better software for different projects that has been very difficult to deal with hence me using online IDE's
* I need to learn to simplify my code and do less lines instead of prolonging them without the need t0
* I need to focus on basic syntax before I move onto more complicated fundamentals
